		<h2>What is Markup?</h2>
		<p>Is what we use to format page elements.</p>
		<p>
			<em>Everything</em>, we put on a page, that we want to show with a specific
			format rather than simple text, we place inside html tags.
		</p>
		<p><sub>what does this do?</sub></p>
		<p><sup>and this?</sup></p>
		<p>Omg<sup>2</sup>. this is that <mark>it</mark> does!</p>

		<div>
			<h2>what do we use div for?</h2>
			<p>We use us to divide the document into sections.</p>
			<p>Like p, it has a box around it. Think of it as a frame</p>

			<h2>Lists and implied close tags</h2>
			<p>
				List is a type of element that only ever shows inside of another. You need
				to first say if it is an unordered or an ordered list.
			</p>
			<p>
				For some reason, you do not need to add clsing li tags, only because the ul
				or ol tags will be clsoed, i suppose you know when the list ends because it
				has the outside closing tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				this is also true for the p tag, but it gets added all by irself with the
				prerrier extension. I wodner what the list does
				<ul>
					<li>what you know?</li>
					<li>it adds it</li>
					<li>it makes sense</li>
				</ul>
				For implied closed tags it is implied tha browser wil figure out what is what.
