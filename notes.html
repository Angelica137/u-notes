    <h1>My HTML notes</h1>

    <h2>What is Markup?</h2>
    <p>Is what we use to format page elements.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Everything</em>, we put on a page, that we want to show with a
      specific format rather than simple text, we place inside html tags.
    </p>
    <p><sub>what does this do?</sub></p>
    <p><sup>and this?</sup></p>
    <p>Omg<sup>2</sup>. this is that <mark>it</mark> does!</p>

    <p>what is the difference between br and p?</p>

    <div>
      <h2>what do we use div for?</h2>
      <p>We use us to divide the document into sections.</p>
      <p>Like p, it has a box around it. Think of it as a frame</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Lists and implied close tags</h2>
      <p>
        List is a type of element that only ever shows inside of another. You
        need to first say if it is an unordered or an ordered list.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, you do not need to add clsing li tags, only because the
        ul or ol tags will be clsoed, i suppose you know when the list ends
        because it has the outside closing tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        this is also true for the p tag, but it gets added all by irself with
        the prerrier extension. I wodner what the list does
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>what you know?</li>
        <li>it adds it</li>
        <li>it makes sense</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For implied closed tags it is implied tha browser wil figure out what is
        what.
